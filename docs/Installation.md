## Installation

  Unic web framework is for PHP, so it's requires PHP 5.6 or newer. now you won’t need to setup anything just yet.

### Unic can be installed in few steps:

  - [Download](https://github.com/unic-framework/unic/archive/main.zip) the Unic files.
  - Unzip the package.
  - Upload all the Unic folders and files (application, system, .htaccess, index.php) on the server.

```
public_html
├── application
├── system
├── .htaccess
└── index.php
```

  That's it, in the Unic web framework there is nothing to configure and setup. it's always ready to go.

### For Linux

  A quick setup for linux and android devices.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/unic-framework/unic
cd unic
php -S localhost:8080 index.php
```

  That's it, in the Unic web framework there is nothing to configure and setup. it's always ready to go.

### Install with composer :

  - Install `composer` if you have not installed.

```shell
$ composer create-project unic-framework/unic blog
```

  It will create a `blog` directory.
